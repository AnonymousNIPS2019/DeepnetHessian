# The Full Spectrum of Deepnet Hessians at Scale: Dynamics with SGD Training and Sample Size

## Usage
See Jupyter notebook main.ipynb

## Example
![CIFAR10 VGG11](https://github.com/AnonymousNIPS2019/DeepnetHessian/blob/master/CIFAR10_VGG11_train.png?raw=true)
The spectrum of the train Hessian of VGG11 trained on CIFAR10. The plot was generated by exporting the data into a CSV file and plotting it with [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).
